BUGS
====
* When leaving the treehouse, there's a glitch in the graphics
* In the first room, thidney appears before the teleport animation (maybe
  having the welcoming screens can fix that)
* Some actions (e.g. the donut) distinguish between a click and a "held" click.
  Maybe it should be implemented.
* Clicking on items in the inventory does a "button press" effect that depends
  on how long the left click is pressed. The original behaves differently if
  it's a short or long click. The current implementation only has a "short
  click" which doesn't show the effect nicely.
* Executing donut actions while walking will move thidney to the old position
  and make the cursor disappear (until right-click).
* don't try showing "loading" icon while narrator subtitles are on.
* narrator subtitles disappear when the audio stops, even before they finish scrolling.
* room 34 -- "look at" and "use" on the arcade machine doesn't play the "rupert" audio
* kom/cutsconv/bst/bst01g0.smk seems corrupt - check if original game falls back to playing the .flc
* Crash while standing in place in room 63, and an orc attacks you:

MISSING FEATURES
================
* Pause support, GMM - <http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Advanced_Engine_Features#Improved_pause_support>
* Switch to AdvancedDetector
* Graphics transaction extension - <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.games.devel.scummvm/4619>

TODO?
=====
* Rewrite the video player to not use getPixel(), by inheriting and using performPostProcessing
* hide the room loading in blank screen at the end of smk playback? (related to playerStruct+5Eh?)
