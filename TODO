* When leaving the treehouse, there's a glitch in the graphics
* Character scaling doesn't work like the original
* In the first room, thidney appears before the teleport animation (maybe having the welcoming screens can fix that
* Some actions (e.g. the donut) distinguish between a click and a "held" click. Maybe it should be implemented
* Right click doesn't work in the inventory
