BUGS
====
* When leaving the treehouse, there's a glitch in the graphics
* Character scaling doesn't work like the original
* In the first room, thidney appears before the teleport animation (maybe
  having the welcoming screens can fix that)
* Some actions (e.g. the donut) distinguish between a click and a "held" click.
  Maybe it should be implemented.
* Clicking on items in the inventory does a "button press" effect that depends
  on how long the left click is pressed. The original behaves differently if
  it's a short or long click. The current implementation only has a "short
  click" which doesn't show the effect nicely.
* Switching between night and day doesn't update the standing characters'
  actors. example: spiders in room 95
* Executing donut actions while walking will move thidney to the old position
  and make the cursor disappear (until right-click)
